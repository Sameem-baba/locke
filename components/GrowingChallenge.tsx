                    Over 3 million patients are living with cancer in the UK alone, with 1,000 new diagnoses every day.
                    <br /><br />
                    The UK cancer survival rate falls behind many other developed countries, and outcomes for patients are extremely variable.
                    <br /><br />
                    Just 20-30% of cancer patients respond well to the treatment they are offered, which can cost up to Â£90,000 per patient.
                    <br /><br />
                    In every 100 patients treated with immunotherapy, up to 55 will experience severe or even life-threatening side effects. Toxicities attack the skin, colon, endocrine organs, liver, and lungs. Many more patients undergo immunotherapy treatment only to suffer from non-response or eventual relapse.
